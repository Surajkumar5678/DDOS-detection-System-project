# DDOS-detection-System-project
Overview
This project implements a DDoS Detection System designed to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The system monitors network traffic patterns and applies detection algorithms to identify potential DDoS activity. It can be used as a defensive measure to safeguard networks from malicious attacks.

Features

Detection of common DDoS attack patterns
Visual representation of traffic patterns and alerts
Configurable detection parameters
Scalable to handle large amounts of traffic
